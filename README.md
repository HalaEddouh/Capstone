# Capstone

This app is focused on helping those who are new to technolpgy. This could range from help with wifi to fixing your font size. With each question a user types in it will try to find a tutorial that helps best. The user is also able to type in the company they're with and it will call their customer support number.


App evaluation:
Category: Education
Mobile: Website is view only, uses user input, mobile first experience.
Story: Allows users to get hep with their technology problems.
Market: Anyone that isn't skilled with technology can use this help. Sometimes someone might need help with fixing something on their phone or adjusting it to their liking but doesn't know where it's located.
Habit: Users can use this app whenever they need help. Throughout time it would be great to see the user getting used to their device by this app.
Scope: I believe this app won't be technically challenging.
